# hello-world
This is just the beginning. 

Hello everyone. This is Jubair H. Jihad. But i like to called myself as Enigmatic Jihad. I'm just a learner. I have no programming background. But i can say that, 'Programming is in my hurt'. One day i'll be like all of you guys. Cool Programmer, may be hacker. 
I know, the way is not easy. More harder for me. Still i'll try.
